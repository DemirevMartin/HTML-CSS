    <font size="-1">Nordstrom Inc. is an American chain of luxury department stores, also operating in
        Canada and headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1901 by Swedish
        American John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, the company began as a shoe
        retailer and expanded its inventory to include clothing, accessories, handbags, jewelry,
        cosmetics, and fragrances. Select Nordstrom stores also include wedding and home
        furnishings departments. The company also has in-house cafes, restaurants and
        espresso bars.</font>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <font size="-1">In 1887, John W. Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16. After
        landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan and was able to save
        enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington,
        Washington.
        <p>By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only
            shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full
            size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and
            the company&#39;s name was changed to Nordstrom&#39;s Best.
